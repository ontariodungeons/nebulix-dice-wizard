**Safety in Your Adventures: Play Comfortably with Cool Communication Tools!** 

Dungeons & Dragons is all about creativity, teamwork, and epic storytelling!  But sometimes, adventures can get a little intense. That's why we use Safety Tools â€“ they help everyone at the table feel comfortable and have the most fun. 

**Why "Safety Tools" Rock**

* **They give you a voice!** Everyone has different limits. Safety Tools make it easy to say "Hey, let's change this part!" 
* **Keep the adventure rolling:** These help avoid awkward pauses and arguments.
* **Teamwork makes the dream work!** Using Safety Tools together shows you care about everyone having a blast!

**Top Tools for Adventurers (and Parents!)**

* **X-Card:** Like a magic "skip" button, just tap the X to change a scene. No explanation needed!  ([http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg))
* **Lines & Veils:** Set your play boundaries together. "Lines" are things we don't include at all. "Veils" are things we hint at, but don't show in detail. ([https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/30906/what-do-the-terms-lines-and-veils-mean](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/30906/what-do-the-terms-lines-and-veils-mean))
* **Consent Flower:** Green, yellow, red cards let you secretly signal "More of this!", "Okay as is", or "Let's tone it down." Great for subtle changes.
