# The Dice

Both D&D and Pathfinder2 use the same set of polyhedral dice, also known as RPG dice. Here's a breakdown of each die:

* **d4 (four-sided die):** A small pyramid shape, used for minor damage or effects in some spells.
* **d6 (six-sided die):** The standard cube, used for damage from many weapons and spells. 
* **d8 (eight-sided die):**  Shaped like two stacked pyramids, used for some weapon damage and effects.
* **d10 (ten-sided die):** Comes in two varieties:
    * **Standard d10 (numbered 0-9):** Used for percentile rolls (combining with the percentile die). 
    * **Percentile die (d%):** Ten-sided die numbered 10-00, used in combination with the standard d10 to create a 100-point scale (e.g., rolling a 7 on the d10 and a 3 on the d% equals 73).
* **d12 (twelve-sided die):**  A dodecahedron, used for damage from some weapons like greatswords.
* **d20 (twenty-sided die):**  The most important die, used for ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. It determines success or failure based on the rolled number and the difficulty set by the Dungeon Master (DM) in D&D or Game Master (GM) in Pathfinder2.

**How many dice do you need?**

Technically, you only need one of each die to play. However, some situations call for rolling multiple dice of the same type at once.  For example, some spells in D&D might require rolling 8d6 (eight six-sided dice) to determine damage.  Many players prefer to have extra dice, especially d6s, for these situations.

**Dice sets and customization**

Dice come in a variety of colors, materials (plastic, metal), and fonts. Players often collect and personalize their dice sets to reflect their character or preferences.
