## Dice Wizard Table Rules

**The game is a collaborative storytelling experience. These rules are to remind us to have fun, and be mindful of each other:**

1. **LISTEN WHILE OTHERS ARE TALKING**
    * Keep the conversation focused on the game
    * Take notes of NPC names, places, quotes, hints, quests, etc.
    * Ask for a break if we're going off topic

2. **NO DIGITAL DEVICES (LAPTOPS, CELLPHONES, ETC) AT THE TABLE**

3. **DO NOT INITIATE ROLLS AGAINST PARTY MEMBERS**
    * Ask unless agreed upon (attacking, stealth, seduction, etc)

4. **KNOW WHAT YOUR CHARACTER CAN DO, AND KNOW HOW TO READ YOUR SHEET**
    * Ask other players for help if something is unclear
    * Simplify your character. Pick a handful of actions and focus on them for this session
    * Take notes and ask for clarification during breaks, and do what you know confidently your character can do.

5. **SAY WHAT YOUR CHARACTER WANTS TO ACHIEVE, DO NOT SPEAK IN GAME MECHANICS**
    * As an example, instead of saying: "I want to roll a Deception check to the guard", you could say: "Meepo wants to approach the guard and tell them that a beast was seen jumping between the buildings." Then the GM would ask you for a Deception check.

6. **BE RESPECTFUL OF EVERYONE'S TIME**
    * **Combat before your turn**
        * Keep focused while tracking initiative.
        * Prepare your turn beforehand; plan all 3 actions
        * Ready 3d6 and any damage dice you might need to roll
        * Before your turn, pay attention to your teammate
        * Heroes don't hesitate, he brave/decisive; if you're unsure grapple, punch, kick, protect someone
    * **Exploration**
        * Try to engage your teammates in every scene
        * While exploring direct questions to other characters
        * Share information and secrets when the opportunity presents itself

7. **PLAY YOUR BACKSTORY AND CHARACTER FLAWS**

8. **FAIL FORWARD. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A BAD ROLL**
    * Every decision is an opportunity to build your character, or lean on your team for help

**The Game Master is the exception, but I will still try to minimize the visibility of digital devices.**
