Making perfect dice is about as realistic and fun as making the perfect character.

These dice are all amazing and unique, but they don't live up the standards of perfect fruit we're used to seeing in the store. Without your help these dice may never get to experience the highs and lows of being a shiny math rock.

Owning an orphan dice set is unlike a 'generic dice' set

1. Being a foster dice owner grants you a discount for future games, and any merchandise this dice wizard invents along the way
2. You may return your dice to the orphanage to exchange for any other orphan sets
3. These dice will love any attention you give them. If you want to polish and colour the dice I have a small starter kit that has everything you need to level up your set.
