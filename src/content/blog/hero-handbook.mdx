The Hero's Handbook
------------------

### Be Prepared

*   **Always be ready:** You don't need to look at your character sheet or consult the rulebook during your turn. Use what's on your sheet and fill in the blanks between turns.
*   **Listen carefully:** Pay attention while others are taking their turns. Focus on what they're saying and doing.
*   **Collaborate:** Trust your fellow heroes and work together. Don't hesitate to ask for help!
*   **Plan efficiently:** During combat, plan your three actions beforehand. Roll your dice and gather everything you need within three minutes. If you fall down, remember that true heroes always stand back up!

### Play Fair

*   **Follow the rules:** Only roll the dice when appropriate and keep your rolls open for everyone to see. After rolling, wait for the Game Master (GM) or other players to confirm the outcome.
*   **Be creative and considerate:** Roleplay your character and develop your backstory without disrupting the flow of the game or diminishing others' contributions. Avoid stealing, charming, attacking, or undermining other players.
*   **Speak up:** If you feel overlooked or unhappy with your role in the adventure, discuss it privately with the GM after the session. Jot down your thoughts and avoid interrupting the ongoing narrative.

### Inspiration

*   **Efficiency:** Roll your attack and damage dice simultaneously, ideally under one minute. Anticipate potential outcomes based on success or failure.
*   **Teamwork:** Act heroically by protecting your allies and making choices that benefit the group. This includes risking yourself to save someone else. Follow the guidelines set forth in this handbook and contribute to an engaging experience for everyone.
*   **Speedy resolutions:** In combat, declare all three actions at once to maintain momentum. Reactions might be tricky initially, but patience and practice will lead to mastery.
*   **Identify resources:** Find your three d20s and label them according to their designated uses.

### Investigations & Negotiations

*   **Stay relevant:** Choose abilities that complement the current situation instead of introducing unrelated ideas.
*   **Take notes:** Write down the specific actions you wish to pursue later.
