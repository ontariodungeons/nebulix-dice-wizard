A New Kind of Summer Camp

The idea of a summer camp is either nostalgic or strange in the modern age.

The fantasy camp is one that takes all the multicultural and knowledge that has progressed from that earlier model.  

#

3 Kinds of Camps

It is important to understand why these models may need some modifications to make them work.

Fantasy builds upon itself, and the most memorable aspect of a story is when it can be shared.

Most importantly crafts such as 3d printing, dice making, model painting all have a scientific time restriction. These amazing opportunities need time, and space to set before the next step can be followed.

Intergenerational family camp

Summer Camp for kids only

Day Camp

# Fantasy Committee

Camp will be structured in ways that empower your children, and yourself, to feel like you can contribute.  
<br/>It will take a lot of reserve gold to run a camp to hire everyone needed to make this happen. Those amazing parents (that’s you) with skills that can help in anyway are encouraged to offer those skills.  
<br/>Core roles we will need will be:

- Food Prep
- Grounds cleanup
- Instructors

Anyone who is assigned a core role is entitled to a discount on all family members that they bring.

# Participation and Earning Gold

<br/>There will be a camp store, and some things are only exchangeable for gold coins (crafts).

This may sound crazy but using a video game model to convince your kids to sweep and wash dishes is worth the price of admission alone.  
<br/>Watch as your kids offer to clear your table just so they can earn a plastic coin.

Your kids will be assigned a small daily responsibility that they work with another kid to accomplish:

- Setting tables
- Arranging chairs for an event
- Sweeping a common area

# Daily Games and Group Activities

During the day the kids are assigned to classes based on their age groups. There are and camp wide activities, such as meals, swim time, and a time to sit and watch others.

- There will be 2 hours of D&D games played each day
- 1 hour of family gathering
- Evening storytelling

<br/>Everyone under the age of 18 MUST be in their designated spots.

Grown ups can decide how to spend their days; there will be a daily optional game for signup, and some of the classes are allowed to have grown ups.

# Create a World of Your Own

For parents the magic is knowing your kids are happily sleeping, with fellow campers making rounds to ensure that all is quiet and peaceful.

I have watched, and I see parents who love this game, and who also have spent a summer trying to enjoy the outdoors.

These activities can be combined.

The fantasy camp should be:

- Cabins, or camp groups, with the ability for any with trailers to potentially park nearby.
- In a place that has access to a swimmable body of water. (Lifeguards will be provided during a designated swim time for kids)

There will be daily:

- Adventure games (A game that runs throughout the week)
- Pick up games and a free play time slot
- Swim time
- Snack time

# Choose your own adventure

Every kid must attend a class, but they are allowed to select what they want to do for 2 periods during the day.

The courses/classes will be:

Classes:

**Camp Design (all ages)**

Paint and create signposts, markers, and enchant the space as your very own magical place. As a bonus, when families leave they will each be allowed to take one piece of the fantasy camp home as reminder that you were a part of something special.

**Running a game, and being a good player (beginner level)**

**Advanced game techniques for players and game masters (next level)**

**Improv games**

**Fun with mold making (supervised, or for 13+)**

- - Dice
    - Jewelry
    - Soaps
    - Candles
    - Crafty things

**Model painting (Basic, and Advanced options)**

Final Day

- Presentations from all the kids classes
- The final day could be a planned LARP adventure.  

I shall present to you my statistics:  
<br/>\[Insert D&D Card\]

Show the above stuff to your kids but keep this stuff below between you and the other adults.

The activities of the day will allow you to do whatever you desire. It is a ‘fantasy’ camp. You are grown ups and have earned the right to sit in the shade or go for a wander in the woods. We will also have optional organized activities for the adults during the day, but it is your choice how you spend your time.

Once we have exhausted the children, the evenings are yours, or the rest of those adults with courage to play the more complex games that are possibly still beyond our comprehension.

Bring your pokemon, your Warhammer, your old red box D&D, your Gloomhaven, and all that enthusiasm I see every week when I see you talk with your child after the adventure.

This is the kind of place that is going to be so impactful, memorable, and magical that your children will aspire to be a part of the staff (which is why we will offer limited volunteer/sponsorship positions).

This format is modelled after a very successful camp which has made me into the creative mad mage your kids have perhaps met at the table.  
<br/>When the event reaches it’s conclusion, we will send ask for feedback to improve and focus on what worked best, because this is only the first of many adventures for fantasy camp.

# Fantasy Camp evolving from Folk Camps

Folk camps have historically focused on North American historical traditions. The roots were in rooted in an uneasy preservation of a society we have since moved past.  
<br/>It is my belief that the songs and stories shared of those generations are an important milestone that insisted the human spirit move always forward towards greater harmony.

# For the parents

I must say that it has been an absolute pleasure to be a part of the imaginative journey that your children bring each session. I am overwhelmed with joy to watch your transform, and metaphorically level up. The kids are having a great time at the table, and they have been calling for greater adventure.

My role as Game Director is secretly one of a teacher, but I will never reveal that to the adventurers at my table.

I will create 3 levels of experience/expectations for D&D players:

1. Beginner: No requirements other than being respectful and a desire to play. Cross talk, meta-gaming, and having to refer to the manual is discouraged, but is to be expected at this level.
2. Intermediate:
    1. You are expected to know your character sheet, and to have all the information ready to share if asked.
    2. All dice should be rolled at the same time
    3. During combat your turn must be shorter than 2 minutes--that’s 10 minutes a round for a 5 person game if they maxed it out, so we want to think about making the rounds short and snappy so we can get another turn.
3. Advanced:
    1. You are willing to work with the Game Director to include secrets, proficiencies, and a history for your character.
    2. You come to the game bringing your full enthusiasm and attention.
    3. This requires going above just bringing your character, and to play at these tables you’ll need to win the approval of the Game Director and party members.

I run two styles of games:

- Level 1 Beginning players are encouraged to play between level 1 - 6 with others of the same skill and age. Character options are limited to the core books, with less focus on background. Gameplay will focus on combat, and understanding how to read the sheet.
- Intermediate games will run between level 7-12 for players who have a good understanding of the core mechanics. There are more responsibilities of each player to listen, react, and respect each other.

I have never stopped learning and trying to make it something fun, and I have developed a new educational program for ages 9 and older.  
<br/>Here’s what they will learn that you probably only want to retroactively discuss:

1. Colour Theory
2. Chemistry:
    1. Silicone molds or resin will be mixed and discussed to create take home dice
    2. Mixing colours properly requires a basic understanding of chemistry

If you have a child participating you are allowed to enroll, and to learn how to do these activities as well.  
<br/>Your kids are going to get to be mad scientist with lab coats, learning about chemistry while also making amazing looking dice, and creating their own specific paint brand in a bottle to take home.  
<br/>Learning is automatic and subconscious when we’re having fun.

I was raised with Early Childhood Education from my pre-verbal days. If you have infants, you may find my Family’s music useful.

# Model Painting Course

The goal is to teach the basics of getting a model from a box to the game table. We will paint the model in stages each week, while working on painting a other pieces of scenery which are yours to take home after completing the course.

This is an incredible deal, because all the paint and extras will be provided.  

Weeks

1. Prime your models, and learn about painting the base layer of a model.
    1. We begin by **priming** the model you have brought, but this now needs 24-48 hours before we can move to the next step.
    2. Everyone will select a floor, or wall piece from a **primed** selection provided.
    3. Let’s get painting. For this part I will discuss a lot of stuff as we paint, but it’s more important to get the brush moving and play first.
2. Base Layers, Wet Palettes
    1. You will be given the materials to create a low-cost **wet pallet** which you will assemble.
    2. We will paint our models together, learning and experimenting with laying down the base layer.
    3. We can then revisit the scenery piece that has a base layer already dried and apply a **wash** or try **dry brushing**
3. Washes and Dry Brushing
    1. We introduce washes to demonstrate how you can blend the base layers. At this stage you can decide what technique to try on your model. The goal is to add a layer and set it aside again.
    2. Revisit the scenery to add details or start another piece. Practice so that next week you are confident to get into the fine details of your model.
4. Detailing and Bases
    1. Your model is going to be looking pretty good at this stage. I will help suggest ways to level up the work you have already done and discuss the final stages of varnishing/protecting your model.
    2. Your model needs to be attached to a base. I will also provide some primed 3d model bases that you are welcome to take as an alternative to the ones provided with your model.
    3. Glue and attach your model to the base and set it aside for next week.
5. Varnishing and Advanced Paint Techniques
    1. We will take our models and either brush or spray varnish them. This will protect your model so they can be handled and retain their colour. It is still advisable to keep your painted projects away from direct sunlight as much as possible.
    2. I will introduce Mediums and Professional Acrylic paint creates more vibrant colours and effects.
        1. You will have several options available to experiment with professional grade acrylics available, scenery, primed art paper, or canvas.
        2. I will demonstrate how to mix mediums to create contrast and speedpaint effects.

You will have learned the basics of modern model painting.
