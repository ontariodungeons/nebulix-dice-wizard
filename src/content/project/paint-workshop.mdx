## Week 1: Prime Time

Prime your models and learn the technique of painting a base layer
Spray or Brush Primer: This is the first layer of paint for your model
Put the model away: A primed model needs 24-48 hours before safely handling
Let’s get painting: Take a provided primed piece and try painting. It's ok to make mistakes!

## Week 2: Base Layers, and Palettes
Learn about the advantages of using a wet and pallet:
Paint your Model: We will paint our models together, learning why a base layer is important
Today you will create a wet pallet so you have a workspace for your paints
Experiment: Revisit the piece from week 1 to further practice using a brushes and paints4
Bases: The model you brought came with a base.
Glue Safety: Put on gloves and a mask. Apply a small amount glue to the model base

## Week 3: Washes and Dry Brushing
Your model now needs another layer to bring out more detail. This week I will cover
washes how washes can add shading and refine the edges between colours.
Wash Away: Select a wash and paint the edges of your model where more than one
colour meets another.
Learn how to dry brush. Practice on a second piece because this technique can be tricky

## Week 4: Detailing and Bases
Detailing: This is the layer where you add fine details like eyes, and studs on armor, etc.
Primed 3d model bases will be provided.
I will help suggest ways to improve upon the work you have already done and discuss the
final stages of varnishing/protecting your model.
**NEXT WEEK**: Bring something airtight to take your model home


## Week 5: Varnishing and "An Introduction to Advanced Painting"
Varnish: You can either brush or spray varnish your model.
Understanding Pigments: Learn why this is an advanced "secret"
Mediums: Learn how to be mix paint like a mad scientist! Get creative!
